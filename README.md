## What’s This All About?

Welcome to the *Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot* — a simple but smart little console app built in C#. Its job? To help you learn how to stay safe online.

This chatbot was created as part of a Proof of Evidence (POE) assignment for a South African cybersecurity awareness campaign. It chats with users, shares useful safety tips, and responds to questions about common cybersecurity issues like passwords, scams, and online privacy.

 What Can the Chatbot Do?

Here’s what makes the chatbot special:

  It responds in a friendly, conversational way — perfect for casual learning.

-  *Recognizes Key Topics*  
  Ask about things like passwords, privacy, or scams, and it’ll give solid advice.

  You’ll get different phishing safety tips each time to keep things fresh.

  If you're feeling worried, curious, or frustrated, the bot will respond appropriately.
